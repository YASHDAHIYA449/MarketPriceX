📒 Miscellaneous Notebooks (Amazon ML Challenge 2025)

This folder contains all the practice notebooks created while preparing for the Amazon ML Challenge 2025.

These notebooks include:
- EDA experiments  
- Preprocessing trials  
- Model experiments  
- Feature engineering variations  
- Parameter tuning attempts  
- Any other exploratory work done before the final solution  

These files are separate from the main project pipeline and were used purely for learning and experimentation.
